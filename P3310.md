# Introduction

This paper aims to address some lingering issues introduced with the adoption of
P0522R0 into C++17, later made a defect report, which relaxed the rules on how
templates are matched to template template parameters, but didn't concern itself
with how partial ordering and overload resolution would be affected.

As a result, it invalidated several perfectly legitimate prior uses, creating
compatibility issues with old code, forcing implementors to amend the rules,
and overall slowing adoption.

We will point out two separate issues and their proposed solutions, with
the intention that they be adopted as resolutions to [@CWG2398], which is
the core issue tracking this problem.

It is also suggested to bump the version for the feature testing macro.

# Problem #1 - Default Arguments

Consider the following example:
```C++
template<class T1> struct A;

template<template<class T2> class TT1, class T3>
struct A<TT1<T3>>; // #1

template<template<class T4, class T5> class TT2, class T6, class T7>
struct A<TT2<T6, T7>> {}; // #2

template<class T8, class T9 = float> struct B;
template struct A<B<int>>;
```

Prior to [@P0522R0], with the more strict rules, only the partial specialization
candidate `#2` would be considered, since `B` has two template parameters,
`T8` and `T9`, and the template template parameter in `#1` has only `T2` as
a template parameter, so `#1` doesn't match.

After P0522R0, `#1` starts being accepted as a candidate, since `B` can be used
just fine in place of `TT1` in the specialization `A<TT1<T3>>`:
The default argument `float` for `T9` allows `B` to be specialized with
just a single argument.

However, the rules for partial ordering operate considering only the candidates
themselves, without access to `B`, which has the default template argument.
When looking at only those candidates, it's not obvious the specialization
of `TT1` would work, if that were to be replaced with a template with two
parameters.

The only clue is the fact that these two candidates are being considered together:
this must mean that default arguments are somehow involved.

But nonetheless, as things stand, these candidates cannot be ordered,
resulting in ambiguity.

Maintaining the pre-P0522 semantics of picking `#2` would be ideal:
Besides that it would be a compatible change, it is logical that this is the
most specialized candidate.

## Solution to #1

When performing template argument deduction such that `P` and `A` are
specializations of either class templates or template template parameters:

```C++
template <class T1, ... class Tn> TT1
template <class U1, ... class Un> TT2
P = TT1<X1, ..., Xn>
A = TT2<Y1, ..., Ym>
```

Under the current rules, `TT1` will be deduced as `TT2`.

This paper proposes that in this case, only during partial ordering,
`TT1` will be deduced as a new template,
synthesized from and almost identical to `TT2`, except that the
specialization arguments (`Yn, ..., Ym`) will be used as default arguments in
this new invented TT1, replacing any existing ones, effectively as if it had
been written as:

```C++
template<class T1, ..., class Tn, class Tn+1 = Yn+1, ..., class Tm = Ym>
using TT1 = TT2<T1, ..., Tn, Tn+1, ..., Tm>
```

That is, all template arguments used in the specialization of TT2, which would not
have been consumed had them been used in TT1, will be used to deduce the default
arguments for TT2.

In particular, this means that had `Tn` been a parameter pack, no default arguments
will be deduced for `TT2`, as that consumes all arguments.

When binding TT2 to TT1, the extra parameters are not accessible, since the
specialization to TT1 is checked at template parse time, so the usage must match
it's declaration.

So it's possible to conceptually simplify this, and think of this alias template as:

```C++
template<class T1, ..., class Tn> using TT1 = TT2<T1, ..., Tn, Yn+1, ..., Ym>
```

It's useful to think of these invented templates in terms of the equivalences proposed
in [@CWG1286], but the last proposed resolution for that core issue only recognizes
the first form.

This paper is not proposing to standardize a syntax to create this
implicit alias as written, outside of deduction, but for explanatory purposes,
the following syntax will be used: `A:1<float>`.

Where this means, take the template name `A`, and create an alias from it
by applying the following template arguments as defaults, starting from
the second argument. Roughly equivalent to:

```C++
template<class T, class U> struct A {};
template <class T, class U = float> using invented_alias_A_1_float = A<T, U>;
```

This syntax will be used in the rest of this chapter to convey this adjustment.

### Class templates

Conversely, a template template parameter can also be deduced as a class template:
```C++
template <class T1, class T2 = float> struct A;

template <class T3> struct B;
template <template <class T4> class TT1, class T5> struct B<TT1<T5>>;      // #1
template <class T6, class T7>                      struct B<A<T6, T7>> {}; // #2

template struct B<A<int>>;
```

When partially ordering `#1` versus `#2`, TT1 will be deduced as a synthesized template
based on A, with `T7` as default argument for `T2`.

### Consistency

When a parameter is deduced against multiple arguments, there are issues related to consistency, both
in deduced and non-deduced contexts.

Related to the former, given this example:
```C++
template<class T1, class T2> struct A;

template<template<class, class> class TT1, class T1, class T2, class T3>
struct A<TT1<T1, T2>, TT1<T1, T3>> {}; // #1

template<template<class> class UU1, class U1, class U2>
struct A<UU1<U1>, UU1<U2>>; // #2

template struct A<B<int>, B<int>>;
```

Prior to P0522, `#1` would be picked.
This becomes ambiguous after `P0522`, and the rules proposed in this paper
don't help.

The problem is that `UU1` will be deduced as both `TT1:1<T2>` and `TT1:1<T3>`, and these should
in general be treated as different templates, so this would be taken as an inconsistent deduction
under current rules.

It should be possible to make this work and keep the pre P0522 behavior, but the present paper
doesn't go as far yet, and this is left for future work.

This would involve recognizing that we are deducing two templates against each other.
`T2` and `T3` are both template parameters of it, and it's consistent that they could
be deduced to refer to the same type.

Regarding consistency in non-deduced contexts, given this example:
```C++
template<class T> struct N { using type = T; };

template<class T1, class T2, class T3> struct A;

template<template<class, class> class TT1,
         class T1, class T2, class T3, class T4>
struct A<TT1<T1, T2>, TT1<T3, T4>,
         typename N<TT1<T1, T2>>::type> {};

template<template<class> class UU1,
         template<class> class UU2,
         class U1, class U2>
struct A<UU1<U1>, UU2<U2>, typename N<UU1<U1>>::type>;

template<class T8, class T9 = float> struct B;
template struct A<B<int>, B<int>, B<int>>;
```

This was accepted prior to P0522R0, but picking `T2` for the default
argument of `TT1` will result in this example being accepted,
but result in rejection of the symmetric example where `N<TT1<T1, T2>>`
is replaced with `N<TT1<T1, T4>>`, which is also accepted pre-P0522.

This is a similar problem, and this paper does not propose a mechanism
to either keep both working, neither to reject both as ambiguous.
This is left for future work.

### Packs

As a particular consequence of this proposal, default arguments can be deduced for pack
parameters, something which is not ordinarily possible to obtain.

This affects the partial ordering of the following example:
```C++
template<class T1, class T2 = float> struct A;
template<class T3> struct B;

template<template<class T4> class TT1, class T5>
struct B<TT1<T5>>; // #1

template<template<class T6, class ...T7s> class TT2, class T8, class ...T9s>
struct B<TT2<T8, T9s...>> {}; // #2

template struct B<A<int>>;
```

Before P0522, `#2` was picked. After P0522, this changed entirely, now `#1` is picked.

The proposed rules will restore the pre-P0522 behavior, picking `#2` again.

# Problem #2 - With vs Without Packs

Consider the following example:
```C++
template<template<class ...T1s> class TT1> struct A {};
template<class T2> struct B;
template struct A<B>; // #1

template<template<class T3> class TT2> struct C {};
template<class ...T4s> struct D;
template struct C<D>; // #2
```

Before [@P0522R0], `#1` was valid, and `#2` was invalid.

After P0522R0, `#1` stayed valid, and `#2` became valid.

Now consider this partial ordering example:
```C++
template<class T1> struct A;

template<template<class ...T2s> class TT1, class T3>
struct A<TT1<T3>>; // #1

template<template<class T4> class TT2, class T5>
struct A<TT2<T5>> {}; // #2

template<class T6> struct B;
template struct A<B<int>>;
```

Before P0522R0, `#2` was picked.

However, since the same rules which determine a template can bind to a template
template parameter, are also used to determine one template template parameter
is at least as specialized as another, and since P0522R0 made no special
provisions in these rules for the latter, this example now becomes ambiguous.

But this is undesirable, because it is a breaking change, and also because
logically `#2` is more specialized.

The new paragraph inserted with P0522R0, which defines the
'at least as specialized as' rules in terms of function template rewrite,
leads to this confusion:

There is a historical rule which allows packs in the argument to match
non-packs in the parameter side.

The template argument list deduction rules accept packs in parameters and
no packs in arguments, while the reverse is rejected, but in order to accept
both `#1` and `#2` from the first example, both directions need to be accepted.
An exception had to be carved out in [temp.arg.template]{.sref}/3 for this
historical rule.

Note that this is a check for whether the parameter is at least as specialized
as the argument, so the roles are switched around: P takes the role of the argument,
and A takes the role of the parameter.

We propose a solution which will restore the semantics of the second example,
by specifying that during partial ordering, packs must match non-packs only in
the original direction which was accepted prior to P0522, which was a pack on the
argument side matching non-packs in the parameter side.

Additionally, as a consequence of this exception, all implementations seem to reject
combinations of the P0522 and historical rule affordances, which would otherwise
be accepted individually, such as this example:

```C++
template<template<class, int, int...> class> struct A {};
template<class, char> struct B;
template struct A<B>;
```

Where there are packs in parameter side matching non-pack in argument side, and
also matching of NTTPs of different type.

This is a very arbitrary restriction, and we propose to make it clear this is valid.

Now consider this example:
```C++
template <template <class...    > class TT1> struct A      { static constexpr int V = 0; };
template <template <class       > class TT2> struct A<TT2> { static constexpr int V = 1; };
template <template <class, class> class TT3> struct A<TT3> { static constexpr int V = 2; };

template <class ...          > struct B;
template <class              > struct C;
template <class, class       > struct D;
template <class, class, class> struct E;

static_assert(A<B>::V == 0);
static_assert(A<C>::V == 1);
static_assert(A<D>::V == 2);
static_assert(A<E>::V == 0);
```

Before P0522R0, this is accepted.

After P0522R0, this became wholly invalid: The partial specializations are not
more specialized than the primary template. Also, the `A<B>` specialization
becomes ambiguous.

With the proposed solution, the primary template becomes less specialized again.

But the other issue remains: The `A<B>` specialization stays ambiguous.
Here the problem goes outside of the scope of partial ordering.

Now consider this example:
```C++
template <template <class   > class TT> void f(TT<int>); // #1
template <template <class...> class TT> void f(TT<int>); // #2

template <class   > struct A {};
template <class...> struct B {};
void test() {
  f(A<int>()); // selects #1
  f(B<int>()); // selects #2
}
```
After P0522, both calls became ambiguous, but that's so far only a partial ordering
issue, which the solution so far breaks in favor of picking #1.
But before P0522, overload resolution for the second call would only match candidate #2.
Picking #2 is the desirable outcome here, since a pack seems to be a better match for a
pack, and this would also avoid a breaking change.

## Solution to #2

We propose changing the deduction rules such that, only during partial ordering,
packs matching to non-packs isn't accepted both ways, that it should only be
accepted for a pack argument matching to parameter non-packs, which is the opposite direction
it's normally accepted in the deduction of template argument lists.

We also propose removing the classic pack exception clause in
[temp.arg.template]{.sref}/3, in favor of explicitly specifying that
outside of partial ordering, packs matching to non-packs must be accepted
both ways.

Lastly, we propose to introduce a new kind of notional conversion for the purpose of
solving the overload resolution issue.

This is the same principle used in overload resolution, where overloads are ranked according
to the conversions involved when matching arguments to their parameters. Some conversions
are considered better than others, which may lead to certain candidates being considered
better than others.

This new conversion would be defined by the presence of a pack on the argument side matching
a non-pack on the parameter side, whenever packs matching non-packs would also be allowed
in the opposite direction. A candidate would be better when this conversion is not used.

# Wording

Add a new paragraph after [temp.func.order]{.sref}/5:

[5]{.pnum} [Note 3: Since, in a call context, such type deduction considers only parameters for which there are explicit call arguments, some parameters are ignored (namely, function parameter packs, parameters with default arguments, and ellipsis parameters).

::: add
[6]{.pnum} - When matching template template parameters as described in [temp.deduct.type], if P is a specialization of a template template parameter, and A is either also the same kind, or a class template specialization, the template template parameter in P will be deduced as a modified template, as if the template argument list in A were used as the default arguments for its template parameters, starting from the first parameter which has a correspondence in P, up to the last parameter which has a corresponding argument.

\[Example:
```C++
template <class, class = float> struct A {};

template <template <class> class TT, class T> void f(TT<T>);                    // #1
template <template <class, class> class TT, class T, class U> void f(TT<T, U>); // #2

template <template <class> class TT, class T> void g(TT<T>); // #3
template <class T, class U> void g(A<T, U>);                 // #4

void test(A<int> a) {
  f(a); // selects #2
  g(a); // selects #4
}
```
- end example\]
:::

Remove [temp.arg.template]{.sref}/3, moving the non-crossed-out section to the next paragraph, with further modifications:

[3]{.pnum} A template-argument matches a template template-parameter P when P is at least as specialized as the template-argument A. In this comparison, if P is unconstrained, the constraints on A are not considered. [If P contains a template parameter pack, then A also matches P if each of A's template parameters matches the corresponding template parameter in the template-head of P. Two template parameters match if they are of the same kind (type, non-type, template), for non-type template-parameters, their types are equivalent ([temp.over.link]), and for template template-parameters, each of their corresponding template-parameters matches, recursively. When P's template-head contains a template parameter pack ([temp.variadic]), the template parameter pack will match zero or more template parameters or template parameter packs in the template-head of A with the same type and form as the template parameter pack in P (ignoring whether those template parameters are template parameter packs).]{.rm}

[4]{.pnum} [A template-argument A matches a template template-parameter P when P is at least as specialized as A, ignoring constraints on A if P is unconstrained.]{.add} A template template-parameter P is at least as specialized as a template template-argument A if, given the following rewrite to two function templates, the function template corresponding to P is at least as specialized as the function template corresponding to A according to the partial ordering rules for function templates.

If the rewrite produces an invalid type, then P is not at least as specialized as A.
