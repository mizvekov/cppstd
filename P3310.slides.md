# **P3310: Solving issues introduced by relaxed template template parameter matching**

Matheus Izvekov <<mizvekov@gmail.com>>

# Introduction

Before C++17, a template template parameter (TTP) could only match an argument if it had exactly the same template head.
Or otherwise if the parameter had a pack, which then could match any number of equivalent parameters.

---
With the adoption of P0522R0, this rule was relaxed in order to more broadly allow matching compatible templates.
A template could now be matched to a TTP whenever this template could be specialized with all arguments the TTP could.

---
However, P0522R0 was discovered to be incomplete, as initially described in CWG2398, and after it was merged into the standard and made a DR.

The new rules had an undesired impact on partial ordering and overload resolution which had not been considered before, affecting old code bases which had previously valid and reasonable code.

Vendors ended up not fully implementing what was agreed. They ignored the DR aspect, added workarounds, and gated the feature behind compiler flags.

---
This paper aims to standardize a solution to this problem, allowing the changes introduced in P0522R0 to be fully implemented
and made a DR, with a much smaller impact on existing code.

---
# Problem #1 - Default arguments

As a consequence of the relaxed rules, default arguments on template parameters allowed a TTP with less parameters to accept an argument with more parameters, as long as the extra ones had default arguments.

---
P0522R0 broke the following partial ordering example:
```C++
template<class T1> struct A;
template<template<class T2> class TT1, class T3> struct A<TT1<T3>>; // #1
template<template<class T4, class T5> class TT2, class T6, class T7>
struct A<TT2<T6, T7>> {}; // #2

template<class T8, class T9 = float> struct B;
template struct A<B<int>>;
```

* Before P0522R0, only `#2` matches (exact match).
* After P0522R0, `#1` matches as well.
---

With both candidates matching, there is no way currently to partial order them.
This results in an ambiguity.

Partial ordering works by matching candidates against each other,
and neither template template parameter has default arguments in its template head.

---
## Solution

This paper proposes to fix partial ordering in this case, so that it results in `#2` being selected.

This is accomplished by allowing the deduction of default arguments for template template parameters, during partial ordering.

---

Suppose both sides (P and A) of deduction are template specializations, where P specializes a template template parameter:
```C++
P = T<int>
A = X<int, char>
```

* Under current rules, `T` is always deduced as `X`.
* With the proposed rules, but only during partial ordering, `T` will be deduced as a modified template, the same as `X` in all aspects except that the default argument for its second parameter will be deduced as `char`, overriding existing default argument, if any.

---
# Problem #2 - Packs

With the changes in P0522R0, packs match non-packs in both directions, whether one appears in the parameter side, and the other on the argument side.
This causes ambiguity when partial ordering, as candidates will match each other both ways.

---
Example 1:
```C++
template<class T1> struct A;
template<template<class ...T2s> class TT1, class T3> struct A<TT1<T3>>;    // #1
template<template<class    T4 > class TT2, class T5> struct A<TT2<T5>> {}; // #2

template<class T6> struct B;
template struct A<B<int>>;
```

* Before P0522R0, `#2` was picked.
* After P0522R0, when partial ordering, both candidates match each other, so they cannot be ordered.

---
Example 2:
```C++
template <template <class   > class TT> void f(TT<int>); // #1
template <template <class...> class TT> void f(TT<int>); // #2

template <class   > struct A {};
template <class...> struct B {};
void test() {
  f(A<int>()); // selects #1
  f(B<int>()); // selects #2
}
```
After P0522, both calls became ambiguous.

---
For the first call, both candidates matched, and partial ordering selected `#1`.

For the second call, only `#2` matches.

This cannot be solved in partial ordering alone, as the backwards compatible solution has to pick a different candidate for each case.

---
Additionally as a mechanical consequence of how P0522 was implemented in the wording, by keeping the original exact match rule around as fallback, the relaxed match cannot be used together with the original pack-non-pack match rule.

---
Example 3:
```C++
template<class, char> struct A;

template<template<class, int> class> struct B {};
template struct B<A>; // OK

template<template<class, int, int...> class> struct C {};
template struct C<A>; // Bad, char does not match int
```

Here `char` would match `int` normally, but since `C<A>` has a pack in C and no pack in A, we fall back to the original exact match rule, which applies to the entire list, and now `char` doesn't match `int` anymore.

---
This is a very arbitrary restriction, and the behavior is odd and hard to explain, where a change in one parameter affects how
a different parameter matches, which looks like spooky action at a distance.

This paper proposes to fix this problem by scraping the original rule, and integrate the mechanics of the original pack match exception
into the new rules, under the appropriate conditions.

---
## Solution

This paper proposes a two part solution to this problem:
* For partial ordering, only accept pack-to-non-pack matching in the original direction, which was accepted before P0522.
* For overload resolution, we create a tie-breaker rule, which favors the candidate which did not have a pack match a non-pack in the original direction.

---
Example 2 (repeated):
```C++
template <template <class   > class TT> void f(TT<int>); // #1
template <template <class...> class TT> void f(TT<int>); // #2

template <class   > struct A {};
template <class...> struct B {};
void test() {
  f(A<int>()); // selects #1
  f(B<int>()); // selects #2
}
```
As applied to this example, the first bullet breaks the ambiguity in favor of `#1` for both calls, and the second bullet then fixes the second call so it selects `#2`.
