# Introduction

This paper aims to address some lingering issues introduced with the adoption of
P0522R0 into C++17, later made a defect report, which relaxed the rules on how
templates are matched to template template parameters, but didn't concern itself
with how partial ordering would be affected.

As a result, it invalidated several perfectly legitimate prior uses, creating
compatibility issues with old code, forcing implementors to amend the rules,
and overall slowing adoption.

We will point out two separate issues and their proposed solutions, which can be
picked and voted independently, with the intention that they be adopted as
resolutions to [@CWG2398], which is the core issue tracking this problem.

The intent is to keep old code working, not to change best practices.
With that said, these proposed rules should keep things more consistent and
explainable, as candidates having template template parameters with more
non-pack parameters will be more specialized than those with fewer, and those
taking pack parameters will be less specialized than those than don't.

If any of the solutions is adopted, it is suggested to bump the version
for the feature testing macro.

# Problem #1 - Default Arguments

Consider the following example:
```C++
template<class T1> struct A;

template<template<class T2> class TT1, class T3>
struct A<TT1<T3>>; // #1

template<template<class T4, class T5> class TT2, class T6, class T7>
struct A<TT2<T6, T7>> {}; // #2

template<class T8, class T9 = float> struct B;
template struct A<B<int>>;
```

Prior to [@P0522R0], with the more strict rules, only the partial specialization
candidate `#2` would be considered, since `B` has two template parameters,
`T8` and `T9`, and the template template parameter in `#1` has only `T2` as
a template parameter, so `#1` doesn't match.

After P0522R0, `#1` starts being accepted as a candidate, since `B` can be used
just fine in place of `TT1` in the specialization `A<TT1<T3>>`:
The default argument `float` for `T9` allows `B` to be specialized with
just a single argument.

However, the rules for partial ordering operate considering only the candidates
themselves, without access to `B`, which has the default template argument.
When looking at only those candidates, it's not obvious the specialization
of `TT1` would work, if that were to be replaced with a template with two
parameters.

The only clue is the fact that these two candidates are being considered together:
this must mean that default arguments are somehow involved.

But nonetheless, as things stand, these candidates cannot be ordered,
resulting in ambiguity.

Maintaining the pre-P0522 semantics of picking `#2` would be ideal:
Besides that it would be a compatible change, it is logical that this is the
most specialized candidate.

## Solution to #1

When performing template argument deduction such that `P` and `A` are
specializations of either class templates or template template parameters:

```
P = TT1<X1, ..., Xn>
A = TT2<Y1, ..., Yn>
```

Under the current rules, `TT1` will be deduced as `TT2`.

This paper proposes that in this case, `TT1` will be deduced as a new template,
synthesized from and almost identical to `TT2`, except that the
specialization arguments (`Y1, ..., Yn`) will be used as default arguments in
this new invented TT2, replacing any existing ones, effectively as if it had
been written as:

```C++
template<class T1 = Y1, ..., class Tn = Yn> class TT2
```

Conversely, a template template parameter can also be deduced as a class template:
```C++
template <class T1, class T2 = float> struct A;

template <class T3> struct B;
template <template <class T4> class TT1, class T5> struct B<TT1<T5>>;   // #1
template <class T6, class T7>                      struct B<A<T6, T7>>; // #2

template struct B<A<int>>;
```

When partially ordering `#1` versus `#2`, TT1 will be deduced as a synthesized template
re-declaration of A with `<T6, T7>` as default arguments.

When these proposed rules are applied to class template deduction, this example,
which is unrelated to partial ordering, also becomes valid:
```C++
template<class T, class U> struct A {};
A<int, float> v;
template<template<class> class TT> void f(TT<int>);
void g() { f(v); }
```
Here, 'TT' picks a synthesized re-declaration of 'A' which has 'float' as the
default argument for the second parameter.

When a parameter is deduced against multiple arguments, consistency must be enforced.

Given this example:
```C++
template<class T> struct N { using type = T; };

template<class T1, class T2, class T3> struct A;

template<template<class, class> class TT1,
         class T1, class T2, class T3, class T4>
struct A<TT1<T1, T2>, TT1<T3, T4>,
         typename N<TT1<T1, T2>>::type> {};

template<template<class> class UU1,
         template<class> class UU2,
         class U1, class U2>
struct A<UU1<U1>, UU2<U2>, typename N<UU1<U1>>::type>;

template<class T8, class T9 = float> struct B;
template struct A<B<int>, B<int>, B<int>>;
```

This was accepted prior to P0522R0, but picking `<T1, T2>` for the default
arguments of `TT1` will result in this example being accepted,
but result in rejection of the symmetric example where `N<TT1<T1, T2>>`
is replaced with `N<TT1<T1, T4>>`, which is also accepted pre-P0522.

There is no known mechanically simple and sound way to solve this.
It would not be simple, but sound, if the solution were to include a mechanism
to deduce that T2 and T4 must be the same type.
Unless there is sufficient motivation to try to salvage this situation, it's
proposed that both forms be rejected, for consistency.

To achieve this consistency, multiple deductions must be combined by
stripping out differing default arguments.

## Wording for #1

Modify §13.10.3.6 [temp.deduct.type]{.sref}/8:

[8]{.pnum} A template type argument T, a template template argument TT, or a
template non-type argument i can be deduced if P and A have one of the
following forms:

| cv~opt~ T
| T*
| T&
| T&&
| T~opt~ [i~opt~]
| T~opt~ (T~opt~) noexcept(i~opt~)
| T~opt~ T~opt~::*
| TT~opt~\<T\>
| TT~opt~\<i\>
| TT~opt~\<TT~[opt]{.add}~\>
| TT~opt~\<\>
::: add
| TT~opt~
:::

[8.1]{.pnum} - T~opt~ represents a type or parameter-type-list that either
satisfies these rules recursively, is a non-deduced context in P or A,
or is the same non-dependent type in P and A,

[8.2]{.pnum} - TT~opt~ represents either a class template or a
template template parameter,

::: add
\[Example:
```C++
template<class T, class U> struct A {};
template<template<class> class TT> void f(TT<int>);
void g() {
  A<int, float> v;
  // OK, TT = A, 'float' is used as default argument the second parameter
  f(v);
}
```
- end example\]

[8.3]{.pnum} - When matching TT~opt~ specializations, TT~opt~ will be deduced
as if it's template argument list in A were used as the default arguments for
it's template parameters, up to the last parameter which has a corresponding
argument.
When multiple such arguments are deduced, only default arguments which are
common to all deductions are kept.

   void g(TT<int, Alloc<int>>);

# Problem #2 - With vs Without Packs

Consider the following example:
```C++
template<template<class ...T1s> class TT1> struct A {};
template<class T2> struct B;
template struct A<B>; // #1

template<template<class T3> class TT2> struct C {};
template<class ...T4s> struct D;
template struct C<D>; // #2
```

Before [@P0522R0], `#1` was valid, and `#2` was invalid.

After P0522R0, `#1` stayed valid, and `#2` became valid.

Now consider this partial ordering example:
```C++
template<class T1> struct A;

template<template<class ...T2s> class TT1, class T3>
struct A<TT1<T3>>; // #1

template<template<class T4> class TT2, class T5>
struct A<TT2<T5>> {}; // #2

template<class T6> struct B;
template struct A<B<int>>;
```

Before P0522R0, `#2` was picked.

However, since the same rules which determine a template can bind to a template
template parameter, are also used to determine one template template parameter
is at least as specialized as another, and since P0522R0 made no special
provisions in these rules for the latter, this example now becomes ambiguous.

But this is undesirable, because it is a breaking change, and also because
logically `#2` is more specialized.

The new paragraph inserted with P0522R0, which defines the
'at least as specialized as' rules in terms of function template rewrite,
leads to this confusion:

The template argument list deduction rules accept packs in parameters and
no packs in arguments, while the reverse is rejected, but in order to accept
both `#1` and `#2` from the first example, both directions need to be accepted.
An exception had to be carved out in [temp.arg.template]{.sref}/3 for this.

We propose a solution which will restore the semantics of the second example,
by specifying that during partial ordering, packs must match non-packs in only
one direction.

Now consider this last example:
```C++
template <template <class...    > class TT1> struct A      { static constexpr int V = 0; };
template <template <class       > class TT2> struct A<TT2> { static constexpr int V = 1; };
template <template <class, class> class TT3> struct A<TT3> { static constexpr int V = 2; };

template <class ...          > struct B;
template <class              > struct C;
template <class, class       > struct D;
template <class, class, class> struct E;

static_assert(A<B>::V == 0);
static_assert(A<C>::V == 1);
static_assert(A<D>::V == 2);
static_assert(A<E>::V == 0);
```

Before P0522R0, this is accepted.

After P0522R0, this became wholly invalid: The partial specializations are not
more specialized than the primary template. Also, the `A<B>` specialization
becomes ambiguous.

With the proposed solution, the primary template becomes less specialized again.

But the other issue will remain: The `A<B>` specialization will stay ambiguous.
A solution to this last problem is left for future work.

## Solution to #2

We propose changing the deduction rules such that, only during partial ordering,
packs matching to non-packs isn't accepted both ways, that it should only be
accepted in the argument to parameter direction, which is the opposite direction
it's normally accepted in the deduction of template argument lists.

We also propose scratching the classic pack exception clause in
[temp.arg.template]/3{.sref}, in favor of explicitly specifying that
outside of partial ordering, packs matching to non-packs must be accepted
both ways, parameter to argument as well as argument to parameter.

## Wording to #2

Modify §13.10.3.6 [temp.deduct.type]{.sref}/9:

[9]{.pnum} If P has a form that contains \<T\>[ or]{.rm}[,]{.add} \<i\>, [or \<TT~opt~\>, ]{.add} then each argument P~i~ of the respective template argument list of P is compared with the corresponding argument A~i~ of the corresponding template argument list of A. If the template argument list of P contains a pack expansion that is not the last template argument, the entire template argument list is a non-deduced context.
[If P~i~ is a pack expansion, then the pattern of P~i~ is compared with each remaining argument in the template argument list of A. Each comparison deduces template arguments for subsequent positions in the template parameter packs expanded by P~i~. During partial ordering, if A~i~ was originally a pack expansion:]{.rm}

::: rm
[9.1]{.pnum} - if P does not contain a template argument corresponding to A~i~ then A~i~ is ignored;

[9.2]{.pnum} - otherwise, if P~i~ is not a pack expansion, template argument deduction fails.

[9.2.2]{.pnum} - [otherwise, if A~i~ is not a pack expansion, template argument deduction fails.]{.add}

\[Note: (9.2) is the reverse of (9.1) - end note\]
:::

Modify §13.4.4 [temp.arg.template]{.sref}/3:

[3]{.pnum} A template-argument matches a template template-parameter P when P is at least as specialized as the template-argument A. In this comparison, if P is unconstrained, the constraints on A are not considered. [If P contains a template parameter pack, then A also matches P if each of A's template parameters matches the corresponding template parameter in the template-head of P]{.rm}. Two template parameters match if they are of the same kind (type, non-type, template), for non-type template-parameters, their types are equivalent ([temp.over.link]{.sref}), and for template template-parameters, each of their corresponding template-parameters matches, recursively. When P's template-head contains a template parameter pack ([temp.variadic]{.sref}), the template parameter pack will match zero or more template parameters or template parameter packs in the template-head of A with the same type and form as the template parameter pack in P (ignoring whether those template parameters are template parameter packs).
