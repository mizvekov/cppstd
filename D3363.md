# Introduction

With the eventual adoption of [@P3310R2], during partial ordering,
default arguments will be deduced for template template parameters.

That paper was presented to EWG including a proposal to apply this
default argument deduction outside of partial ordering as well,
which was approved with consensus.

This was proposed in order to make the language more regular and explainable,
as we wouldn't be introducing another piece of black magic that applies only
to partial ordering.

However, CWG decided that this change wasn't appropriate for a paper titled
'Solving partial ordering issues', and they proposed a change of title,
the inclusion of a few examples of potential breakages, and sending it back
to EWG.

This paper proposes instead to split that change off of P3310, and present it
here instead.

# Problem

As presented in [@P3310R2], default argument deduction applies to class templates
as well, because we need partial ordering for this example to remain valid:

```C++
template <class T1, class T2 = float> struct A;
template <class T3> struct B;
template <template <class T4> class TT1, class T5> struct B<TT1<T5>>;      // #1
template <class T6, class T7>                      struct B<A<T6, T7>> {}; // #2
template struct B<A<int>>;
```

When default argument deduction is applied outside of partial ordering, this
example also becomes valid:
```C++
template<class T, class U> struct A {};
A<int, float> v;
template<template<class> class TT> void f(TT<int>);
void g() { f(v); }
```
Here, 'TT' picks a deduced alias of 'A' which has 'float' as the
default argument for the second template parameter `U`.

This deduced alias template must be different from the underlying template A, in case any
deduced default arguments actually differ from what is declared in A.

So `f` deduced from `A<int, float>` will be a different specialization than one deduced from `A<int, double>`.

This has some overlap with [@CWG1286], and it's expected the same consequences should apply regarding name mangling.

As explained in [@P3310R2], this default argument deduction covers pack parameters as well.
So the following example should become valid:
```C++
template <class T1, class ...T2s> struct A {
  static constexpr auto val = sizeof...(T2s);
};

template <template <class T3> class TT> void f(TT<int> v) {
  static_assert(v.val == 3);
};
void test() {
  f(A<int, void, void, void>());
}
```

The default argument deduction has one additional consequence:
```C++
template<class T, class Alloc = std::allocator<T>> class vector {};

template<template<class> class Container>
  auto f(Container<int>) -> Container<float>;

vector<int> v;
vector<float> x  = f(v);
```

Where as with [@P0522R0] this would work as intended, this deduction would
produce a `vector<float, std::allocator<int>>`, which might not be desirable
in this case.

This example was created for exposition, and not extracted from any
real world use case. It's not clear this is a 'good idea' that we would like
to preserve.

But in any case, it's possible to create an adjustment that would keep this
working as in [@P0522R0], if there is inclination towards it, so this is left
for future work.

# Potential breakages

As with any changes that make valid any formerly invalid overloads, this can
potentially cause breakages because a different overload might be selected.

Consider this slight variation of the example presented previosuly:

```C++
template<class T, class U> struct A {};
A<int, float> v;

template<template<class> class TT> void f(TT<int>); // #1
template<template<class> class TT> void f(...);     // #2

void g() { f(v); }
```

Now since `#1` was not a valid overload before, `#2` was picked, which made this
program valid.

With this change, `#1` will be picked instead, which could potentially change
the program.

But `#1` accepts a template template parameter with one argument, and the default
argument deduction provides one such template, which is derived from a template
the user wrote and used in this context, with one small and reasonable assumption
that `float` would work as an argument to the second parameter.

So it's likely that in a reasonably written program, picking `#1` would just work
and provide the intended semantics.

# Wording changes

Add a new paragraph to [temp.deduct.type]{.sref}:

::: add
[25]{.pnum} - When matching TT~opt~ specializations, TT~opt~ will be deduced
as if its template argument list in A were used as the default arguments for
its template parameters, starting from the first parameter which has a
correspondence in P, up to the last parameter which has a corresponding
argument.
:::

Modify example in [temp.alias]{.sref}/2:

\[Example 1:

```diff
@@ -13,7 +13,8 @@
 template<template<class> class TT>
   void f(TT<int>);

-f(v);               // error: Vec not deduced
+// OK, TT = vector, Alloc<int> is used as default argument for the second parameter
+f(v);

 template<template<class,class> class TT>
   void g(TT<int, Alloc<int>>);
```
â€” end example\]
